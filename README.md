# Engram - Cognitive Mesh Architecture

**Author**: Vincent Kaufmann
**Affiliation**: Engram Research, Dubai, UAE
**Date**: February 2026

## Overview

Engram is a cognitive architecture that replaces autoregressive token prediction with iterative diffusion-based reasoning, biological state modulation, and associative memory.

Core components:

- **Cognitive Mesh** - Modular neural interconnect with specialized nuclei
- **Biological Architecture** - 72-dim internal state engine with FiLM conditioning
- **Associative Memory** - Persistent episodic recall with reflexive retrieval
- **Grid Diffusion Transformer (GDiT)** - Discrete diffusion for spatial reasoning
- **World Model** - Inner diffusion for mental simulation and hypothesis testing
